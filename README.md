# Bike-Sales-Dashboard-using-Excel
This project is a representation of Excel skills, to build a dashboard on the given Bike sales data and draw conclusions based on the results. 

Step 1: 
1. Created Multiple worksheets such as Working Sheet, Pivot Tables and Charts and Dashboards
2. Cleaned the data by removing duplicates from the data.
3. Made changes to the data by replacing short notations like M -> Male, F -> Female, etc. which can be understood clearly.
4. Also added a new column known as Age brackets which will categorize the age if Age<31 -> Adolescence, if Age>=31 and Age<=54 -> Middle Age and if Age>54 -> Old Age.
5. And pushed the sheet with the file name Bike Sales Dashboard- Cleaned Data

Step 2:
1. Created a pivot table and pivot chart with the x and y axes as the Average income of both males and females vs. whether they purchased the bike or not. To come to the intuition that the average is playing a role in the purchases of the bike.
2. Also made another pivot table as Average Commute Distance vs Bike Purchase. To see if the commute distance is playing a role in the purchase of the bike or not.
3. Came up with another pivot chart to get a visual representation if the age of the people is an influence in the purchase of the bike or not.
